# Spring Functions on Azure

Serverless Hype

- simplicity
- low cost
- highly scalable
- 0 maintenance

Azure Functions - event driven serverless compute platform from Azure

Spring Cloud Function has specific support for Azure
- basically a wrapper around cloud provider...

$$$ pay by requests on serverless
pay per bucket of RAM
pay for traffic, storage, monitoring ...

Cold start exists because vms shutdown when not in use

JVM vs GraalVM

JVM os the easiest path tooling exists for debugging performance and developer experience however jvm is slow to start so cold starts can be an issue

GraalVM is new

complex to use and build  limitations also exist
very fast startup time and very low memory consumption it is compiled as a native image

hello-spring-function-azure is the example

SpringBootApplication annotation is supported and gives us access to the fullness of spring libraries
less dependence on the cloud provider

maven plugin for azure functions exists to run and deploy

- creates storage account, service plan with function inside, app insights for monitoring

use linux to deploy to azure it functions better


## moving to graalvm

get less config from azure
- must declare port
- needs a json config file for deployment
- compile script **tip use upx to zip giving you a binary that will improve cold start
- download unzip and run is the lifecycle
- github action can be used to build and deploy this is better because you can use github's linux vms to build your binary
- Difficult to test as a native image
- builds slowly
- cannot use war ecosystem


micronaut quarkus and spring are competitors
